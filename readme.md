# ECE796-Lab2
## AI-assisted IMU sensor data collection
## By: Yash Patel - ECE 796 - Spring 2026

## Objectives
• Set up hardware system for IMU (LSM6DSV16X) data collection
• Add LSM6DSV16X library to ESP-IDF
• Configure I2C bus for data communication
• Use AI to assist with the data collection from IMU (LSM6DSV16X) via I2C

## Issues with Milestone 1:
Original GPIO pins that AI found were incorrect, after 1 iteration AI found the correct GPIO pins (GPIO1 and GPIO2)
